# Purpose of project

In the age of digital communication and widespread access to information, people are growing interested in discovering and sharing recipes from diverse culinary traditions.
However, there is a need for a simple and efficient platform where individuals can collaboratively share their favourite recipes while benefiting from version control to maintain the quality and accuracy of these culinary treasures.
Traditional recipe-sharing websites often lack the transparency and collaborative capabilities that Git and GitHub offer, making it challenging to track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain a structured repository of recipes.

# How to contribute recipes
1. Navigate to the  project
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
3. Under "Owner," select the dropdown menu and click an owner for the forked repository.
4. By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. Optionally, to further distinguish your fork, in the "Repository name" field, type a name.
5. Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description of your fork.
6. Optionally, select Copy the DEFAULT branch only.
    
    (For many forking scenarios, such as contributing to open-source projects, you only   need to copy the default branch. If you do not select this option, all branches will be               copied into the new fork.)
7. Click Create fork.

# Version control
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
